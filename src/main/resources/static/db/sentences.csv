287,8,I, They tell me I walked the day I was a year old.
287,8,I, I have lived some thirty years on this planet, and I have yet to hear the first syllable of valuable or even earnest advice from my seniors.
287,8,I, If I had remembered this it would have prevented some mistakes.
287,8,I, This was not the light in which I hoed them.
287,8,I, The greater part of what my neighbours call good I believe in my soul to be bad, and if I repent of anything, it is very likely to be my good behaviour.

288,8,You, What you lose on the swings you gain (or get back) on the roundabouts.
288,8,You, Write down the advice of him that loves you, though you like it not at present.
288,8,You, A dog will not howl if you beat him with a bone.
288,8,You, Your father�s honour is to you but a second-hand honour.
288,8,You, Happiness is a perfume you cannot pour on others without getting a few drops on yourself.
288,8,You, If you want knowledge, you must toil for it.
288,8,You, You cannot judge a tree by its bark.
288,8,You, When the horse is stolen, (you) lock the stable door.
288,8,You, You can�t touch pitch without being defiled.
288,8,You, If you can't stand the heat get out of the kitchen.
288,8,You, Love as in time to come you should hate, and hate as you should in time to come, love.
288,8,You, I tell you hopeless grief is passionless.
288,8,You, If they say you are good, ask yourself if it be true.
288,8,You, Grasp the nettle and it won't sting you.
288,8,You, I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.
288,8,You, Do not to others what you do not wish them to do to you.
288,8,You, You win some, you lose some.
288,8,You, You can't have your cake and eat it.
288,8,You, You have no goats, and yet you sell kids.
288,8,You, Though you cast out nature with a fork, it will still return.

297,8,him, She asked him questions.
297,8,him, She bought him a camera.
297,8,him, She bought him a ticket.
297,8,him, She forced him to do it.
297,8,him, She forgot to write him.
297,8,him, She ignored him all day.
297,8,him, She is in love with him.
297,8,him, She is listening to him.
297,8,him, She liked him right off.
297,8,him, She made a bet with him.
297,8,him, She made him a new coat.
297,8,him, They could not give him any help.
297,8,him, Alex smiled down at him in a reassuring way.
297,8,him, The big boy looked at him and blew it again.
298,8,us, Come with us.
298,8,us, Do you know us?
298,8,us, Come and help us.
298,8,us, Deal us the cards.
298,8,us, Stay here with us.
298,8,us, Come along with us.
298,8,us, He doesn't like us.
298,8,us, He seems to know us.
298,8,us, His speech moved us.
298,8,us, Will you go with us?
298,8,us, It's all over for us.
298,8,us, All of us were silent.
298,8,us, He teaches us English.
298,8,us, Nobody can control us.
298,8,us, She taught us singing.
298,8,us, He wouldn't believe us.
298,8,us, It's time for us to go.
298,8,us, He asked us to help him.
298,8,us, Try us again next Monday.
298,8,us, He wanted to come with us.
298,8,us, One of us will have to go.
298,8,us, They made us work all day.
298,8,us, Tom is teaching us French.
298,8,us, Come over here and join us.
298,8,us, He showed us some pictures.
298,8,us, What he said made us angry.
298,8,us, I wish you had come with us.
298,8,us, Why not have dinner with us?
298,8,us, Our mother bought us a puppy.
298,8,us, He came to ask us to help him.
298,8,us, I expect that he will help us.
298,8,us, This work is difficult for us.
298,8,us, Where will the bus pick us up?
298,8,us, He advised us against doing it.
298,8,us, He came to ask us for our help.
298,8,us, He may come and see us tonight.
298,8,us, He tried to speak French to us.
298,8,us, The boss gave us all a day off.
298,8,us, Tom lives in the room above us.
298,8,us, He amused us with a funny story.
298,8,us, Maybe you'd better come with us.
298,8,us, She sang a Japanese song for us.
298,8,us, She told us not to make a noise.
298,8,us, She told us the road was closed.
298,8,us, We can depend on her to help us.
298,8,us, He has the least money of us all.
298,8,us, He is ahead of us in mathematics.
298,8,us, She was only too glad to help us.
298,8,us, There is no need for us to hurry.
298,8,us, He can sing better than any of us.
298,8,us, He gave us quite a lot of trouble.
298,8,us, His speech impressed us very much.
298,8,us, Mary is going to help us tomorrow.
298,8,us, Bad weather kept us from going out.
298,8,us, Can you read that sign ahead of us?
298,8,us, He warned us not to enter the room.
298,8,us, Tom told us that he had a headache.
298,8,us, His sudden appearance surprised us all.
298,8,us, They won't allow us to enter the garden.
298,8,us, A heavy snowstorm kept us from going out.
298,8,us, Come and visit us in Paris sometime soon.
298,8,us, He believes that there is a spy among us.
298,8,us, Are you sure you don't want to go with us?
298,8,us, All of us want to live as long as possible.
298,8,us, He told us a very exciting adventure story.
298,8,us, It's strange that Ken doesn't agree with us.
298,8,us, The driver told us which bus we should take.
298,8,us, I don't know if he will visit us next Sunday.
298,8,us, As soon as we sat down, she brought us coffee.
298,8,us, I think it's time for us to come to an agreement.
298,8,us, Our parents live right across the street from us.
298,8,us, If you can't make it, call us as soon as possible.
298,8,us, I can't tell you how much your support means to us.
298,8,us, I completely forgot to make something for us to eat.
298,8,us, I'm looking forward to touring bookstores in the US.
298,8,us, I would appreciate any information you can send to us.
298,8,us, Be sure to drop us a line as soon as you get to London.
298,8,us, The delay forced us to stay overnight in an expensive hotel.
298,8,us, I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
298,8,us, I plan to contact Tom by phone tomorrow and ask him to help us.
298,8,us, Stop beating around the bush and tell us what you really think.
298,8,us, What he told us the other day simply doesn't make sense, does it?
298,8,us, I'll get in touch with Tom by telephone tomorrow and ask him to give us a hand.
298,8,us, I thought a bunch of people would go water skiing with us, but absolutely no one else showed up.
299,8,them, We kept them quiet.
299,8,them, We sometimes see them.
299,8,them, All of them went there.
299,8,them, We sometimes meet them.
299,8,them, All of them are not poor.
299,8,them, I don't like any of them.
299,8,them, I want to see them again.
299,8,them, The news made them happy.
299,8,them, He stopped to talk to them.
299,8,them, I asked them to fix my car.
299,8,them, I don't know either of them.
299,8,them, I don't want either of them.
299,8,them, I invited them to the party.
299,8,them, My plan was adopted by them.
299,8,them, Both of them are in the room.
299,8,them, I bought them each a present.
299,8,them, I'll have them repair my car.
299,8,them, Which of them is your brother?
299,8,them, We advised them to start early.
299,8,them, I'm considering going with them.
299,8,them, The two of them are in the room.
299,8,them, Tom recommended the novel to them.
299,8,them, We provided food and clothes for them.
299,8,them, Go say goodbye to them before they leave.
299,8,them, He hasn't written to them in a long time.
299,8,them, My association with them didn't last long.
299,8,them, He has not written to them for a long time.
299,8,them, I agree with them that we should try again.
299,8,them, I found them lying on the artificial grass.
299,8,them, I want to ask them when their wedding day is.
299,8,them, He told them that he had had a wonderful time.
299,8,them, I hope neither of them was injured in the crash.
299,8,them, A lot of people look up to you. Don't let them down.
299,8,them, I have a few questions. Would it be OK if I asked them?
299,8,them, There is an urgent need for them to update their system.
299,8,them, If you stack the dishes up by the sink, I'll do them later.
299,8,them, I put some cookies on the table and the kids ate them right up.
299,8,them, I have two dogs and I try to feed them each the same amount of food.
299,8,them, I tried hard to make them stay home, but they refused to listen to me.
299,8,them, There were sparks between them from the start.
299,8,them, A sudden gust of wind circled them and whispered words in her mind.
299,8,them, We'll take care of them together.
299,8,them, She retrieved them from her purse and handed them to him.
299,8,them, Dragging it up again wouldn't do either of them any good.
299,8,them, Jonathan was watching them intently.
299,8,them, After lunch, all four of them went outside to play ball.
299,8,them, The sudden rush into space confused them so that they could not think.
299,8,them, This was a very interesting experience to them.
299,8,them, But the pulling of them apart and pushing them together again was only a sleight-of-hand trick.
299,8,them, He would drive them from place to place as his master wished.
299,8,them, The shepherd and his dog could not keep them together.
299,8,them, The shepherd soon lost sight of them in the darkness.
299,8,them, The king had sent them there to make the people obey his unjust laws.
299,8,them, My guess is that such people have some genetic factor protecting them against the adverse effects of bacon.
299,8,them, I tried vainly to put them together.
299,8,them, I did not eat them
299,8,them, Many are the travellers I have spoken concerning them, describing their tracks and what calls they answered to.
299,8,them, The count met the guests and saw them off, inviting them all to dinner.

300,8,One, Tom has one kid.
300,8,One, Tom owes me one.
300,8,One, Try another one.
300,8,One, Wait one moment.
300,8,One, You have one hour.
300,8,One, You take this one.
300,8,One, Can I see that one?
300,8,One, Can I see this one?
300,8,One, Check this one out.
300,8,One, Didn't you get one?
300,8,One, Give me a good one.
300,8,One, Give me one minute.
300,8,One, Here's another one.
300,8,One, Here's one for you.

300,8,One, I'll buy a new one.
300,8,One, I'll take that one.
300,8,One, I'll take this one.
300,8,One, I'm no one special.
300,8,One, I'm the guilty one.
300,8,One, It's a strange one.
300,8,One, It's the other one.
300,8,One, It's the wrong one.
300,8,One, Let me get you one.
300,8,One, Let's buy this one.
300,8,One, Let's get that one.
300,8,One, Let's try one more.
300,8,One, Let's use this one.
300,8,One, No one can do that.
300,8,One, No one can hear us.
300,8,One, No one can help me.

310,8,hers, He lifted the cup to take a sip and his eyes met hers accusatively.
310,8,hers, Yet, one backward glance at the hard lines of the face over hers reminded her that there was more than the gentle side to him.

310,8,hers, He bent and touched his mouth to hers.
310,8,hers, I dovetailed my work arrangements with hers.

324,8,itself, Just pull the door shut. It'll lock by itself.
324,8,itself, Eventually, the problem may take care of itself.
324,8,itself, The frame itself is worth more than the picture.

325,8,ourselves, I suppose we could try to find Tom ourselves.
325,8,ourselves, Just between ourselves, I don't think he's going to succeed.
325,8,ourselves, We are not as happy or unhappy as we imagine ourselves to be.
325,8,ourselves, I bet we've all asked ourselves that same question more than once.
325,8,ourselves, Let's do it ourselves.
325,8,ourselves, Let's play by ourselves.
325,8,ourselves, We've got one ourselves.

325,8,ourselves, Let's keep this matter to ourselves.
325,8,ourselves, We enjoyed ourselves at the seaside.
325,8,ourselves, We have to look after ourselves now.
325,8,ourselves, We prepared ourselves for the crash.
325,8,ourselves, Let's sun ourselves on the sun porch.

325,8,ourselves, We protected ourselves against danger.

325,8,ourselves, We discussed the matter among ourselves.
325,8,ourselves, Let's keep this matter between ourselves.
325,8,ourselves, We can't start second-guessing ourselves.
325,8,ourselves, We enjoyed ourselves at a sukiyaki party.
325,8,ourselves, It looks like we've gotten ourselves lost.
325,8,ourselves, We should've taken care of that ourselves.

325,8,ourselves, We must all ask ourselves the same question.
325,8,ourselves, We should acquaint ourselves with the facts.
325,8,ourselves, That's a question we're all asking ourselves.
325,8,ourselves, Tom and I introduced ourselves to each other.
325,8,ourselves, We are prone to judge every one by ourselves.
325,8,ourselves,  When do we get to do something for ourselves?
325,8,ourselves, We stop loving ourselves when no one loves us.
325,8,ourselves, It looks like we got ourselves a little problem.
325,8,ourselves, That's a question we've all been asking ourselves.
325,8,ourselves, Why don't we introduce ourselves to our neighbours?
325,8,ourselves, We glutted ourselves with lobsters and other seafood.
325,8,ourselves, Let's start the ball rolling by introducing ourselves.
325,8,ourselves, Let's see if we can work out our problems by ourselves.
325,8,ourselves, We're distancing ourselves from the rest of the family.
325,8,ourselves, We're supposed to try to solve our problems by ourselves.
325,8,ourselves, You're not expected to do anything we wouldn't do ourselves.
325,8,ourselves, We're not asking you to do anything we wouldn't do ourselves.
